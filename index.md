### CPSC 120

* [Lab 1](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2023/cpsc-120-lab-01-vcr.git)

    Lab 1 was my first favorite lab as cliche as it may sound. This lab was my favorite because I can still remember how excited and nervous I was to be coding for the first time ever. This lab taught me everything. I learned how to git clone, git status, git push. I learned how to make a PAT, how to make a folder. This lab will always have a soft spot for me since it was my first.

* Lab 4
    
    Lab 4, part 1 was my second favorite lab. It was my favorite because I always wondered how I was able to search up What is 3 cups in oz? and I would get the correct answer in seconds. I was able to not only write one of my first intermediate codes but, I was able to write a program that would convert millimeters into the multiple units of measure we have.

* Lab 9
    
    Lab 9, part 2 was my third favorite lab. It was my second favorite because it was full of if and else statements and those were my overall favorite thing to do, along with printing error messages and this lab was full of just that. In this lab I learned how to use if/ else statements along with file i/o.
