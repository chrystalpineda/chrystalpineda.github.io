### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was my first favorite lab as cliche as it may sound. This lab was my favorite because I can still remember how excited and nervous I was to be coding for the first time ever. This lab taught me everything. I learned how to git clone, git status, git push. I learned how to make a PAT, how to make a folder. This lab will always have a soft spot for me since it was my first.
